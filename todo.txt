 * transient window rules are broken

 * push 'new window' tag as next for toggle view and don't toggle tag on new window
   push 'urgent' too?

 * unswallow should attachabove (same as 'new window')

 * layout each tag with its layout, combining multiple layout a sub-clients

	required change:
		void (*arrange)(Monitor *);
    to:
	    struct LayoutZone {
	        Monitor* m;
	        int wx, wy, ww, wh;   /* window area  */
	    }
		void (*arrange)(LayoutZone *);

	and struct Client could be with a Window or a LayoutZone*
	all tags' LayoutZone created as non-Window Clients

	LayoutZone* zones[DIM(tags)];

	effectively:
		for tagset = a|b
			a->arrange(numclients(a) + 1)
		and resize(b, ...) would call
			b->arrange(numclients(b))

	possible a,b ordering:
	 - as is
	 - order by layout if different
	 - order by time (not practicle for monview(, 0))

	for a call to arrange, count number of Clients: skip duplicates and empty LayoutZones
	adapt nexttiled() method for count and iteration
	make arrangemon() set a global to new value at each call (time?)
	set arrangeid on each client to track duplicates in chain
	same for zones for debug purposes (and avoid infinite loop)

 * Requirement for merging branches: add config file with:
   - tags (with names and associated keys)
   - rules (as is, but optional fields can have default value)
   - colors (already done, but could be a part of this)
   - mappings ? or possibly mappings to put in rules
   (json? -> find simple c implementation for that, stick to 'ini' style otherwise)

 * fix window placement after restart (changes after hide/show bar)

 * change rotatemon() to swapselmonclients({.i = [-1,+1])

******************************
done:
 * add cycle current view through monitors (mon[n].view[c] -> mon[n+1].view[c] ; mon[n+1].view(c))
	-> right click on status
 * fix "previous layout should never be same a toggle one", ensure both are never equal
 * an empty view should not be added to "previous"
 * fix: don't switch view on things like "opened new tab in browser", set view's urgent flag
 * remove in/out view stack (useless)
 * fix or remove: restore layout after last view's window deleted

 * special video view ("v"):

view(null) ->
if (no windows in video)
	toggle with previous view
else()
	toggle with video
end()

	on video view, window removed from video -> toggle with previous view

	(video view is not saved saved in views for view(null) (?))

 * add qtwebflix rule (fullscreen)
 * have saved layouts in list (stack) with added combinations (1 to 9 and then n|m combinations): don't mess up other view's layout

 * fix pango warning
" Invalid UTF-8 string passed to pango_layout_set_text()"
only happens when draw more text than possible (prevent string clipping)

 * try having any fullscreen window on the 'v' tag
 * swap view's vs properties when rotating only one view
 * when setting a window fullscreen, rotate 'v' tag if a window is already present
 * don't toggle view when exiting fullscreen of window initialy on vtag
 * rotate current view should keep source view if a window is present afterwards
